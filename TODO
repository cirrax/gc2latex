Tax calculation
---------------
Gnucash does for each tax line a rounding.
This leads to different taxes caclulated by gnucash or gc2latex if a tax consists of multiple values.

For Tax and rounding also see https://lists.gnucash.org/pipermail/gnucash-devel/2009-January/024605.html
and the gnucash bugs mentioned there.
